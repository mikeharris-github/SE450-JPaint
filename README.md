# SE450-JPaint

As part of my DePaul graduate class SE450 (Object-Oriented Software Development), students were asked to build an "MS Paint"-like application in Java called JPaint. It allowed the students to implement various design patterns and object-oriented programming concepts such as interfaces, abstract classes, and other concepts that were taught throughout the course. 

The JPaint contains the following features:

- Pick a shape
  - Ellipse
  - Triangle
  - Rectangle
- Pick a primary color
- Pick a secondary color
- Select a shading type 
  - Outline
  - Filled-in
  - Outline and filled-in
- Click and drag to draw a shape
- Click and drag to select shapes
- Click and drag to move selected shapes
- Copy selected shapes
- Paste copied shapes
- Delete selected shapes
- Undo last action
- Redo last action
- Group selected shapes
- Ungroup selected shapes
- Selected shapes have dashed outline
